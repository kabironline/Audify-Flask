<body>
  <p>Dear Channel Owner,</p>

  <p>We hope this message finds you well. It has come to our attention that there hasn't been any recent activity on
    your channel.</p>

  <p>We understand that maintaining a channel can be demanding and sometimes circumstances may arise that require your
    attention elsewhere.</p>

  <p>While we're sad to see a lack of recent activity, we want you to know that we're here to support you. Whether you
    need assistance, guidance, or simply someone to talk to, our team is always available.</p>

  <p>Remember, your channel is a reflection of your creativity, passion, and dedication. Whenever you're ready to
    return, your audience will be here to welcome you back with open arms.</p>

  <p>In the meantime, take all the time you need. We wish you strength, comfort, and peace during this time.</p>

  <p>With heartfelt condolences,</p>
  <p>The Team at Audify</p>
